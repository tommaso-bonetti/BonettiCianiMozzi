# e-Mobility for All - R&DD

## Overview

This project was developed as part of the final exam for the Software Engineering 2 course at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/), taught by prof. Elisabetta Di Nitto.

It consists of preparing the Requirements Analysis and Specification Document (RASD) as well as the Design Document (DD) for the application e-Mobility for All (eMall). eMall has two main goals:

1. Allow electric vehicle users to find charging stations near them, book a charge, start the charging process and pay for the charge upon completion.
2. Allow charging point operators to manage their stations both manually and automatically, regulating the charging process of connected vehicles and acquiring energy from distribution system operators as needed.
